# EPD Models using openLCA

This repository showcases Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) generated using 
**openLCA**, **EXIOBASE**, and **Ecoinvent** databases. These models were developed to 
analyze life cycle impacts and produce ISO 14025 and EN 15804 compliant EPDs for 
clients such as **MSSL Group** and **Raymond**.

---

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Streamline Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) workflows to generate verified EPDs.
- **Tools Used:** 
  - openLCA for LCA modeling
  - EXIOBASE and Ecoinvent databases for environmental impact data
  - Python for data preparation and automation
- **Impact:** Reduced reporting time by **30%** through optimized data modeling.

---

## Features
- Developed **10+ openLCA models** for products across India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam sites.
- Created documentation aligned with **ISO 14025** and **EN 15804** standards.
- Integrated datasets from EXIOBASE and Ecoinvent to improve data accuracy.
- Automated parts of the data import/export process to minimize manual effort.
